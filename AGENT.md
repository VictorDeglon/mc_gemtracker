# Repo Guidelines

This repository contains a small Bukkit plugin called **GemTracker**. When making code changes you should follow these guidelines:

- **Build and test** using Gradle. Run `gradle test` before committing any change.
- Source code lives under `src/main/java` and resources under `src/main/resources`.
- Keep the coding style consistent with the existing files. Use plenty of explanatory
  comments so the code is easy to understand for beginners.
- Update the README whenever features or usage instructions change.
